  abstract = {This document contains a review on the quark model, prepared for lectures at the Niccolo Cabeo School at Ferrara in May 2012. It includes some historical aspects, the spectral properties of the 2-body and 3-body Schroedinger operators applied to mesons and baryons, the link between meson and baryon spectra, the role of flavour independence, and the speculations about stable or metastable multiquarks. The analogies between few-charge systems and few-quark bound states will be underlined.},

@article{Ananthanarayan2022,
  abstract  = {In this special issue being brought in the centenary year of the birth of Yoichiro Nambu, we exemplify on his discovery of spontaneous symmetry breaking in elementary particle physics, and review precision pion physics in the present era. The notion of spontaneous symmetry breaking in elementary particle physics was introduced by Nambu, and found a realization in the strong interaction sector. It allows one to view the pions as the approximate Nambu-Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken axial-vector symmetries associated with the (near) masslessness of quarks. Inspired by the phenomenon of superconductivity of condensed matter physics, Nambu found this application in a remarkable tour de force. Nambu's work in collaboration with G. Jona-Lasinio gave a dynamical model where such pions may arise. Pions today play the role of being sensitive probes of the ground state of quantum chromodynamics, the Lagrangian field theory of the strong interactions with (confined) quark and gluon degrees of freedom, and whose ground state spontaneously breaks the approximate chiral symmetry. The presence of non-zero quark masses renders the symmetries approximate, and yet the properties of the low-energy sector can both be described and measured at high precision both in experiment and on the lattice. Notable physical quantities include the neutral pion lifetime and pion scattering lengths. An important role of pions is their contribution to the hadronic radiative corrections to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, which is being measured at high precision at Fermilab. We review some of the important aspects of the state of the art. We also say some words about the outstanding contributions of the recently departed Murray Gell-Mann who was a pioneer in the field initiated by Nambu.},

  abstract  = {In a Poincaré-covariant vector-boson-exchange theory, the pion possesses components of pseudovector origin, which materially influence its observable properties. For a range of such quantities, we explore the consequences of a momentum-independent interaction, regularized in a symmetry-preserving manner. The contact interaction, while capable of describing pion static properties, produces a form factor whose evolution for Q20.17GeV2 disagrees markedly with experiment and whose asymptotic power-law behavior conflicts strongly with perturbative QCD. © 2010 The American Physical Society.},
